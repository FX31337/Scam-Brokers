## Actions to take

If you believe you got scammed, find below suggested actions to take.

### Report a scam or fraud

- [Report a scam or unauthorized firm at FCA][30].
- For Swiss financial market, [report an incident to FINMA][31].
- Contact the bank to report the fraud and check whether the deposit is eligible for a chargeback.
- Report the broker on services such as: [BBCR][33], [BSA][34] and other.
- If broker's software is hosted on MQL5.com, report it to [Service Desk at MQL5][35] (in *Profile*).
- Report the broker's website to [Google's Safe Browsing][36] to warn others.
- File a case at [Forex Peace Army Court][37].
-  Use [ICANN's WHOIS Lookup][38] to check the owner of the domain (or use [`whois` command][39]).

  - If they're hiding their true identity behind protected WHOIS, try sending the e-mail to the protected e-mail (it'll be forwarded), if won't help, contact [*WhoisGuard*][40]. You can also file a complaint to the [Better Business Bureau][41] and [ICANN][42]. You can also take a legal action to make *WhoisGuard* to reveal the identity of the person who victimized them, read: [WhoisGuard Complaint][43].

  - If they're hosted on GoDaddy, check on [GoDaddy WHOIS database][44] directly.

In addition, if you're UK's citizen, you can:

- Contact [Citizens Advice][45] consumer service to get an advice.
- Complain to the [Ombudsman Association][46].
- Contact [ConsumerLine][47] to make a complaint against a trader, report a fraud or ask about your consumer rights.

### Litigation

As a last resort, due to the high costs, you can look for a law firm specialising in Forex & Binary Options litigation. They can help you with diligence report on target company, legal documentation, out-of court settlement or any other statutory legislation applicable in your own country. They can also give you an advice whether you may be entitled to claim a chargeback from your bank. However, be careful to not get into another scam company.
